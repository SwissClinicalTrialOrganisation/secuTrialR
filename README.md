# secuTrialR ![travis](https://api.travis-ci.com/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR.svg?branch=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR)

An R package to handle data from the clinical data management system
(CDMS) [secuTrial](https://www.secutrial.com/en/).

## Installing from github with devtools

``` r
devtools::install_github("SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR")
```

## Basic usage

Load the package

``` r
library(secuTrialR)
```

Load a
dataset

``` r
export_location <- system.file("extdata", "s_export_CSV-xls_CTU05_longnames_sep_ref.zip",
                               package = "secuTrialR")
ctu05 <- read_secuTrial(export_location)
```

This will load all sheets from the export into an object of class
`secuTrialdata`, which is basically a list. It will always contain
`export_details` (which are parsed from the HTML ExportOptions file that
secuTrial generates). By default, it will also contain all other files
in the dataset. secuTrialR automatically strips file names of dates. The
new file names can be seen via `ctu05$export_options$data_names`. The
function also adds [labels to variables](#variable-labels) and
data.frames, converts [categorical variables to
`factor`s](#prepare-factors) and ensures that [dates are `Date`s and
date-times are `POSIXct`](#prepare-dates). `read_secuTrial` is a wrapper
for the functions described below, so it is possible to achieve more
flexibility by using the individual functions (if necessary). Individual
tables can be extracted from the `ctu05` object via `tab <- ctu05$tab`,
where `tab` is the table of interest.

#### Load the dataset

``` r
# prepare path to example export
export_location <- system.file("extdata", "s_export_CSV-xls_BMD.zip",
                               package = "secuTrialR")
# load all export data
bmd_export <- read_secuTrial_export(data_dir = export_location)

# load a second dataset
export_location <- system.file("extdata", "s_export_CSV-xls_CTU05_longnames_sep_ref.zip",
                               package = "secuTrialR")
ctu05 <- read_secuTrial_export(export_location)

# View names of the bmd_export object
names(bmd_export)
```

    ##  [1] "export_options" "fs"             "cn"             "ctr"           
    ##  [5] "is"             "qs"             "qac"            "vp"            
    ##  [9] "vpfs"           "atcn"           "atcvp"          "cts"           
    ## [13] "bmd"            "atbmd"

`read_secuTrial_export` returns an object of class `secuTrialdata`,
which is basically a list. It will always contain `export_details`
(which are parsed from the HTML ExportOptions file that secuTrial
generates). By default, it will also contain all other files in the
dataset. secuTrialR automatically strips file names of dates. The new
file names can be seen via `bmd_export$export_options$data_names`.
<!-- DEDICATED ACCESSOR FUNCTION FOR DATA_NAMES? might already be implemented in the print method -->

`bmd_export` is a list, with class `secuTrialdata`. To prevent it from
printing all data to the console, a special print method returns some
useful information about the objects within `bmd_export` instead. The
information returned includes the original file name in the datafile,
it’s name in the `secuTrialdata` object, together with the number of
rows and columns and a column indicating whether the object is metadata
or
    not:

``` r
bmd_export
```

    ## SecuTrial data imported from C:/R/R-3.4.2/library/secuTrialR/extdata/s_export_CSV-xls_BMD.zip 
    ##  table nrow ncol  meta original_name
    ##     vp    1   10  TRUE        vp.xls
    ##   vpfs    1    2  TRUE      vpfs.xls
    ##     fs    1    7  TRUE        fs.xls
    ##     qs    1    7  TRUE        qs.xls
    ##     is    3    8  TRUE        is.xls
    ##    ctr    1    3  TRUE       ctr.xls
    ##     cn  113   13  TRUE        cn.xls
    ##   atcn    0    6  TRUE      atcn.xls
    ##  atcvp    0   11  TRUE     atcvp.xls
    ##    qac    0   10  TRUE       qac.xls
    ##    cts    0    8  TRUE       cts.xls
    ##    bmd  504   27 FALSE       bmd.xls
    ##  atbmd    0   28 FALSE     atbmd.xls

Individual tables can be extracted from the `bmd_export` object via `tab
<- bmd_export$tab`, where `tab` is the table of interest.
<!-- accessor function? -->

#### Variable labels

For creating tables, it is often useful to have access to variable
labels. secuTrialR supports two main methods for handling them - a named
list, or via variable attributes. The list approach works as follows.

``` r
labs <- labels_secuTrial(bmd_export)
# query the list with the variable name of interest
labs[["age"]]
```

    ## [1] "Age"

The attribute based approach adds labels as an attribute to a variable,
which can then be accessed via `label(var)`.

``` r
labelled <- label_secuTrial(bmd_export)
label(labelled$bmd$age)
```

    ## [1] "Age"

Labels can be added to new variables or changed via

``` r
label(labelled$bmd$age) <- "Age (years)"
label(labelled$bmd$age)
```

    ## [1] "Age (years)"

Where units have been defined in the SecuTrial database, they can be
accessed or changed analogously (here, age had no unit assigned, but we
can add one).

``` r
units(labelled$bmd$age)
```

    ## NULL

``` r
units(labelled$bmd$age) <- "years"
units(labelled$bmd$age)
```

    ## [1] "years"

There is a drawback to the attribute based approach - labels will not be
propagated if variables are derived and may be lost if variables are
edited.

Currently, `label_secuTrial` should be used prior to `dates_secuTrial`
or `factorize_secuTrial` so that labels and units are propagated to
factor and date variables.

#### Prepare factors

It is often useful to have categorical variables as factors (R knows how
to handle factors). secuTrialR can prepare factors easily.

``` r
factors <- factorize_secuTrial(ctu05)
```

This functions loops through each table of the dataset, creating new
factor variables where necessary. The new variables are the same as the
original but with `.factor` appended (i.e. a new variable called
`sex.factor` would be added to the relevant form).

``` r
# original variable
str(factors$ctu05baseline$gender)
```

    ##  int [1:17] 1 NA NA 2 1 2 1 NA NA 1 ...

``` r
# factor
str(factors$ctu05baseline$gender.factor)
```

    ##  Factor w/ 2 levels "male","female": 1 NA NA 2 1 2 1 NA NA 1 ...

``` r
# cross tabulation
table(original = factors$ctu05baseline$gender, factor = factors$ctu05baseline$gender.factor)
```

    ##         factor
    ## original male female
    ##        1    5      0
    ##        2    0      5

#### Prepare dates

Date(time)s are a very common data type. They cannot be easily used
though in their export format. This is also easily rectified in
secuTrialR:

``` r
dates <- dates_secuTrial(ctu05)
```

Date variables are converted to `Date` class, and datetimes are
converted to `POSIXct` class. Rather than overwriting the original
variable, new variables are added with the new class. This is a safetly
mechanism in case `NA`s are accidentally
created.

``` r
dates$ctu05baseline[c(1,7), c("aspirin_start", "aspirin_start.date", "hiv_date", "hiv_date.datetime")]
```

    ##   aspirin_start aspirin_start.date     hiv_date   hiv_date.datetime
    ## 1            NA               <NA> 201903052356 2019-03-05 23:56:00
    ## 7      20060301         2006-03-01           NA                <NA>

#### Prepare durations/intervals and times

SecuTrial has the strange setting of returning calculated durations in
the form of integers concatenated together. For example, 21005 might
represent 2 years, 10 months and 5 days, or 306151835 might represent 3
years, 6 months 15 days, 18 hours and 35 minutes. Similarly, clock time
(e.g. 16:20) is represented as 1620, while 08:30 would be 830. Such
variables are useless analytically. `SecuTrialR` can convert them to
something usable/readable though.

``` r
durs <- durations_secuTrial(ctu05)
```

This will add new variables appended with `.dur` for durations or
`.time` for clock time variables. The former are converted to integers
of the smallest unit (e.g. minutes) while the latter are converted to
strings. Additionally, `(smallest unit X)` is appended to labels, where
`X` represents the appropriate unit.

``` r
durs$ctu05baseline[1:7, c("age", "age.dur")] # not a good example
```

    ##   age age.dur
    ## 1  28      28
    ## 2  NA      NA
    ## 3  NA      NA
    ## 4  15      15
    ## 5  52      52
    ## 6  28      28
    ## 7 105     105

``` r
durs$ctu05sae[, c("sae_onset_time", "sae_onset_time.time")]
```

    ##   sae_onset_time sae_onset_time.time
    ## 1           1144               11:44
    ## 2           1731               17:31

#### Recommended approach if not using `read_secuTrial`

``` r
f <- "PATH_TO_FILE"
d <- read_secuTrial_export(f)
l <- label_secuTrial(d)
fa <- factorize_secuTrial(l)
dat <- dates_secuTrial(fa)

# or, if you like pipes
library(magrittr)
f <- "PATH_TO_FILE"
d <- read_secuTrial_export(f)
dat <- d %>% 
  label_secuTrial() %>%
  factorize_secuTrial() %>%
  dates_secuTrial()
```

### Exploratory helpers

`secuTrialR` has a couple of functions to help get to grips with a
secuTrial data export. They are intended to be used in an exploratory
manner only.

#### Visit plan

secuTrialR can provide a depiction of the visit structure, although only
where the visit plan is fixed:

``` r
vs <- visit_structure(ctu05)
plot(vs)
```

<!-- PLOT METHOD DIRECTLY FOR secuTrialdata objects? -->

#### Linking different forms

Linkages amongst forms can be explored with the `links_secuTrial`
function. This relies on the `igraph` package to create a network. It is
possible to interact with the network, e.g. move nodes around in order
to read the labels better. The device ID is returned to the console, but
can be ignored. Forms are plotted in deep yellow, variables in light
blue.

``` r
links_secuTrial(bmd_export)
```

## For contributors

### Testing with devtools

``` r
# run tests
devtools::test("secuTrialR")
# spell check -> will contain some technical terms beyond the below list which is fine
ignore_words <- c("AdminTool", "allforms", "casenodes", "CDMS", "codebook",
                  "codebooks", "datetime" ,"dir" ,"Hmisc" ,"igraph",
                  "labelled", "mnp", "savedforms", "secutrial", "secuTrial", 
                  "secuTrialdata", "tcltk", "tibble")
devtools::spell_check("secuTrialR", ignore = ignore_words)
```

### Linting with lintr

``` r
# lint the package -> should be clean
library(lintr)
lint_package("secuTrialR", linters = with_defaults(camel_case_linter = NULL,
                                                   object_usage_linter = NULL,
                                                   line_length_linter(125)))
```

### Generating the README file

The README file contains both standard text and interpreted R code. It
must therefore be compiled. Changes should be made in the `README.Rmd`
file and the file “knited” with R. This is easiest with RStudio, but
other methods are available.

``` r
library("knitr")
knit("README.Rmd")
```

### Guidelines for contributors

In order to contribute to this R package you should fork the main
repository. After you have made your changes please run the
[tests](README.md#testing-with-devtools) and
[lint](README.md#linting-with-lintr) your code as indicated above. If
all tests pass and linting confirms that your coding style conforms you
can send a pull request (PR).  
The PR should have a description to help the reviewer understand what
has been added/changed. New functionalities must be thoroughly
documented, have examples and should be accompanied by at least one
[test](tests/testthat/) to ensure long term robustness. The PR will only
be reviewed if all travis checks are successful. The person sending the
PR should not be the one merging it.

A depiction of the core functionalities for loading can be found
[here](inst/extdata/secuTrialR.png).
